No. Microsoft automatically deletes your images and videos after processing and does not train on your data to enhance the underlying models. Video data does not leave your premises, and video data is not stored on the edge where the container runs. Learn more about privacy and terms of usage.
 
The model customization feature of the service is optimized to quickly recognize major differences between images, so you can start prototyping your model with a small amount of data. You may start with as little as one image per label. If you have more labeled images, you may add more. Depending on the complexity of the problem and degree of accuracy required, you can continue adding additional images per label to improve your model.
 
You can label the images in Azure Machine Learning Studio, which is integrated with Vision Studio for easy export of labeled data. You can also label the data in the COCO file format and import the COCO file directly in Vision Studio. See documentation for details.
 
The model customization feature for Azure AI Vision is the next generation of Custom Vision, with improved accuracy and few-shot learning capabilities. You may continue to use Custom Vision, or you can migrate your training data to retrain your model with model customization from Azure AI Vision. See documentation for details.
 
After using Azure AI Vision to extract insights and text from images and video, you can use text analytics to analyze sentiment, Translator to translate text into your desired language, or Immersive Reader to read the text aloud, making it more accessible. Related services and capabilities include Azure AI Document Intelligence to extract key-value pairs and tables from documents, Azure AI Video Indexer for extracting advanced metadata from audio and video files, and Content Moderator to detect unwanted text or images.
 
Working adults aren't the only ones affected. Kids who stare at tablets or use computers during the day at school can have issues, too, especially if the lighting and their posture are less than ideal.

CVS is similar to carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive motion injuries you might get at work. It happens because your eyes follow the same path over and over. And it can get worse the longer you continue the movement.
 
When you work at a computer, your eyes have to focus and refocus all the time. They move back and forth as you read. You may have to look down at papers and then back up to type. Your eyes react to images constantly moving and changing, shifting focus, sending rapidly varying images to the brain. All these jobs require a lot of effort from your eye muscles. And to make things worse, unlike a book or piece of paper, the screen adds contrast, flicker, and glare. What's more, it is proven that we blink far less frequently when using a computer, which causes the eyes to dry out and blur your vision periodically while working.
 
Computer work gets harder as you age and the natural lenses in your eyes become less flexible. Somewhere around age 40, your ability to focus on near and far objects will start to go away. Your eye doctor will call this condition presbyopia.
 
**Cut the glare.** Change the lighting around you to reduce the effect on your computer screen. If light from a nearby window casts a glare, move your monitor and close the shades. Ask your employer to install a dimmer switch for the overhead fixtures if they're too bright, or buy a desk lamp with a moveable shade that casts light evenly over your desk. You can also add a glare filter to your monitor.
 
**Rearrange your desk.** The best position for your monitor is slightly below eye level, about 20 to 28 inches away from your face. You shouldn't have to stretch your neck or strain your eyes to see what's on the screen. Put a stand next to your monitor and place any printed materials you're working from on it. That way, you won't have to look up at the screen and back down at the desk while you type.
 
**Give your eyes a break.** Follow the 20-20-20 rule. Look away from the screen every 20 minutes or so and look at something around 20 feet away for about 20 seconds. Blink often to keep your eyes moist. If they feel dry, try some artificial tear eye drops.
 
Get your kids' eyes checked, too. Make sure any computers they use are set up at the right height and in the best light. Encourage them to take frequent breaks from the screen to give their eyes a rest.
 
During the routine maintenance, I was taking project backup from PLC Vision120 after completing uploading PLC went to reboot after rebooting PLC did not communicate properly. So we are going to change this PLC due to no easy solution available to the following issues.
 
-We upload the Vision-120 PLC program via Visilogic software. The uploading method was successfully done but after the uploading program, we shut down the PLC and our Laptop for Lunch. after that, I powered the PLC ran the Visilogic app and tried to go online but the PLC did not communicate with the Laptop and also showed a dark screen. After several times tried then I decided to Initialize Reset. After struggling PLC communicated with LAPTOP only for initialization reset mode picture is attached.
 
After completing Bootstrap which shows during initial rest time. After completing this process we tried to download the Uploaded program so the other pictures attached further issues found at the time of downloading.
 
Please I am very very disappointed about this PLC. Kindly give me the best solution on how can i redownload the uploaded project BKPUP. Hope you understand after checking the attached pictures what is the actual issue?
 
COM 4 is already set and Buadrate is 57600 set. I changed the Buadrate from 57600 to 19200 due to not communicating. Please see the attached pics.
 V120 display keypad not working. I checked V120 battery successfully battery shows 3VDC.
 
1). The comment re the battery being low seems to be a mistake from deriving the battery level from a working screen, which would show an external battery level during operation. It is not the plc's battery, as you've checked.
 
2). Your last photo directly above this post shows that the laptop IS communicating with the PLC. The Model etc is shown at the bottom. I would carefully check all cables for errors, as well as noting next point.......
 
Please note again that this is forum is manned by volunteers. It is not the Makers of the PLC responding to your requests. However, from the appearance of all your results it would appear that the PLC is working as best as it can, but has somehow had it's operating system corrupted. This could be due to large power spikes during your work, or even nearby heavy loads or VFDs. The issue is likely easily resolved by the forum, but because we are not on site, it is difficult as we can only go on the information we get.
 
For now I suggest you follow what Visilogic and the PLC are telling you to do. Also check what O/S the plc needs by looking at the program you uploaded and selecting Project Information. This will show you what Visilogic version it was created with. Note this carefully as this is the version you should be working with on your laptop, and using for all the PLC work. Later versions of Visilogic than the one used to first create a program can create issues. This is not a fault, it is the nature of continual improvements.
 
I have been working with Unitronics vision series for the last 3 years, and I agree with that statement (And everything has been working fine on my end, never bought the Unitronics PLCs myself and I want to believe that they are cheap at least) .
 
I think what happened here is the OP downloaded the latest version of Visilogic off the Unitronics website (because that's what Unitronics directs you to do) and now it won't communicate because the O/S in the V120 is probably very old. It's been recommended that the O/S be updated but he hasn't mentioned that he's tried that. It's not the most obvious thing in the world for a new user.
 
The average American worker spends seven hours a day on the computer either in the office or working from home. To help alleviate digital eyestrain, follow the **20-20-20 rule**; take a 20-second break to view something 20 feet away every 20 minutes.
 
Viewing a computer or digital screen often makes the eyes work harder. As a result, the unique characteristics and high visual demands of computer and digital screen viewing make many individuals susceptible to the development of vision-related symptoms. Uncorrected vision problems can increase the severity of computer vision syndrome (CVS) or digital eyestrain symptoms. Viewing a computer or digital screen is different than reading a printed page. Often the letters on the computer or handheld device are not as precise or sharply defined, the level of contrast of the letters to the background is reduced, and the presence of glare and reflections on the screen may make viewing difficult.
 
Viewing distances and angles used for this type of work are also often different from those commonly used for other reading or writing tasks. As a result, the eye focusing and eye movement requirements for digital screen viewing can place additional demands on the visual system. In addition, the presence of even minor vision problems can often significantly affect comfort and performance at a computer or while using other digital screen devices. Uncorrected or under corrected vision problems can be major contributing factors to computer-related eyestrain. Even people who have an eyeglass or contact lens prescription may find it's not suitable for the specific viewing distances of their computer screen. Some people tilt their heads at odd angles because their glasses aren't designed for looking at a computer or they bend toward the screen in order to see it clearly. Their postures can result in muscle spasms or pain in the neck, shoulder or back.
